We startet the process by marking up the two screenshots provided to get an idea of how the two pages are structured. 
We outlined the main elements like h1, h2, nav bars, cards, inputs and so on. We then decided on which page we wanted to implement.

We faced some issues in the first phase as we ended up having different scss files, which later caused complications with GitHub when merging. At one point we weren't able to solve conflicts in the browser and needed to solve several conflicts locally. With some help from one of the teachers in web development we managed to understand the process of commiting, pushing and pulling from GitHub, and from then on we were able to commit, merge and solve conflicts to make progress on the project. 

Even though the assignment stated for us to create elements first, we found it easier to work on the seperate pages and then link the elements to the demo page.
